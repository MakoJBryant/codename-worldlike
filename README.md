# 🌍 Codename Worldlike

A modular Unity prototype designed to explore a new genre: the **worldlike** — a fully traversable, reactive sandbox RPG set on a compact, spherical planet.

Codename Worldlike is both a technical sandbox and a creative foundation. Built with **Unity 6000.0.51f1**, it provides clean architecture, procedural tools, and simulated world systems — all extensible for full game development.
